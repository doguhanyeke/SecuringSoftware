Assume that you have C code with an uint16_t type variable 
and that you wrote 160 bits into it with a careless
 memcpy operation. The memcpy is documented as follows:
DESCRIPTION
The memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src
 to memory area dest. The memory areas must not overlap. 
 Use memmove(3) if the memory areas do overlap.
Which of the following options may occur? 
Note that depending on your reasoning, 
there may be more than one correct answer!

a)Bits that do not fit discarded.
b)Segmentation fault.
c)Some local variables may be overwritten.
d)The process execution flaw may change.
e)Something that is located directly after the variable is overwritten.

Answer: all
